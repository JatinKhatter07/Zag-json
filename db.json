  "Ttile":"The 6 Most Iconic Restaurants in Bangalore, you should not miss",
  "image":"https://zagnow.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/food2-900x500.jpeg",
  "Content1":"Before independence, the incredible breakfast joints to the old-world establishments, that have served iconic personalities like Jawaharlal Nehru and Queen Elizabeth II came from Bengaluru. It is home to some of the country’s most popular restaurants. We’re going down memory lane to list out a few that are must-visits. Bengaluru’s culinary culture has two very distinct sides – the young and the old-school. The former is marked by the string of new cocktail bars, fine-dining restaurants, and experimentative coffee houses that have cropped up in the city. The latter, however, is where most locals’ hearts lie. Serving up decadent ice-cream sundaes, frothy beer, various varieties of buttery dosas, and succulent steaks, vintage restaurants in Bengaluru serve as time capsules, resisting the change in the face of globalization and a pandemic.  In fact, Bengaluru-based historian Ramachandra Guha had once famously stated, “I may die before my favorite café does.",
  
  "Head1":"1. Koshy’s (1952)",
  
  "Content2":"Plausibly one of the most iconic restaurants in Bengaluru, Koshy’s began as a bakery in 1940 and was later built on St. Mark’s Road (where it now stands) in 1952. This restaurant comes with an extensive menu that features many delicious dishes. Regulars would (and continue to) order without so much as a glance at the menu and popular dishes spotted across tables would range from hot dogs to Kerala fried chicken, but not without a glass of tea. Fried food and gingham table cloths are a common feature of the cafe, which has served the likes of Jawaharlal Nehru, Nikita Khruschev, and Queen Elizabeth II. Journalists and students frequent the spot as well, as do a string of families. If visit here must try the chicken live toast, bacon omelet, mushroom toast, ham sandwich, and vegetable cutlet.",
  

  "Head2":"2. The Only Place (1965)",
  "Content3":"This most popular and famous steakhouse, one of the first in the city, on Museum Road, has been offering Bangaloreans the choicest cuts for over 57 years. It first began as Regent Guest House on Brigade Road, frequented by expatriates, US Peace Corp volunteers, Iranians, Palestinians, and other foreigners. Haroon Sulaiman Sait, the founder, stated in an interview with the Indian Express that due to a lack of continental food in the city, international guests would eat breakfast in the hotel, in turn introducing the staff to a range of different foods. Eventually, pizzas and pasta became a common feature in the restaurant. Today, the only notable change at this place is that the burger which once sold for Rs 2 costs a little more than Rs 200.",

  "Head3":"3. India Coffee House (1957)",
  "Content4":"Located a few steps away from The Only Place is this vintage eatery that’s known, as the name suggests, for its coffee. Particularly, filter coffee without the chicory. The space was first launched in the city in 1957 before being shut down by the government due to a change in policies. Almost after around a year, the former staff set up shop on MG Road and named the place India Coffee House. Eventually, branches started to crop up across the country. In Bengaluru, the space continues to draw crowds, despite the scores of artisanal coffee shops that have opened in the city. To date, portraits that tell tales of yesteryears hang on the walls here and the service staff wears a colonial-era red and white uniform. The most popular order from the menu is coffee, masala dosa, beetroot cutlets, and eggs with toast.",

"image":"https://zagnow.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3808012-scaled-1-900x500.jpg",
"Content1":"As studies suggest, there is a strong connection between weight and hair loss, especially if you achieve the former via unhealthy means. What you consume has a direct impact on your body, and the quality of your hair is one of the first telltales of this. A nutrition-rich diet contributes toward hair growth, and lustrous tresses and helps in minimizing hair loss. At the same time, a nutritional deficiency could be one of the biggest reasons for hair breakage and falling. Clearly, there exists a strong connection between weight and hair, one that needs more prodding as below.",

"Head1":"Degrees of weight loss and hair loss",

"Content2":"Before digging deep into the causes of weight/hair loss due to nutritional intake, it is key to know the degrees of loss you’re talking about. Oftentimes, there’s confusion between the falling of hair with hair loss, but that isn’t the case.‍ Losing up to 100 strands of hair a day is normal, and it only means you shed hair faster than some others.‍ So when should you worry about hair loss? When you stop producing new hair or See patches of thin hair cropping up abnormally While genes, age, environmental triggers, and underlying diseases are all responsible for hair loss, weight loss too could trigger your body to lose hair at an alarming rate. And while weight loss by itself cannot contribute towards hair loss, it’s how you lose the kilos that matter.",
"Head2":"How nutritional intake affects your weight and hair",

"Content3":"As stated above, weight loss by itself cannot cause your hair to fall off. It is the underlying causes of the loss of weight that can determine why you’re losing hair. Research has shown that weight loss due to nutritional deficiencies has a direct bearing on hair. Iron deficiency, in particular, is one of the biggest contributors to hair loss. Similarly, studies also indicate that a deficiency of minerals such as zinc, selenium, biotin, and fatty acids as well as vitamins such as A, E, and D can lead to hair loss. At the same time, nutritional intake also causes hormonal changes, which could, in turn, lead to unsustainable weight and hair loss.",

"Head3":"What steps can you take to curb unhealthy weight and hair loss?",
"Content4":"Your hair follicles need the right amount of nutrients to grow and prosper. In other words, eating right can help you curtail hair loss and attain shiny tresses. Similarly, your body needs the right amount of fuel to sustain itself. Nutritional deficiency can cause your weight to drop at the cost of health and, in turn, impact several of your bodily functions. To prevent unhealthy weight and hair loss, you can take several steps. There are scientific methods such as the usage of Minoxidil and Spironolactone in treating hair loss, but they mean medical intervention, high costs, and hassles along the way. To naturally boost hair loss while also keeping your weight under control, it is important to eat a balanced diet and exercise sufficiently. You can also take oral vitamins and minerals to help improve the quality of hair and fight nutritional deficiencies in your body.",

"Title":"Customer Experience From Zag Perspective",

"Content1":"“Customer obsession” – you will most definitely come across these words when you interact with anyone from a new age consumer brand. In simple terms, every brand aims to keep customers at the center of everything they do. This also makes perfect sense. You become a customer’s primary choice of product or service only if you match their expectations. And if you want the customer to keep coming back, customer obsession becomes even more important. This makes ‘providing a stellar customer experience (CE)’ a key goal for most companies. So, for an e-commerce company like Yeloit.com where ease of doing business and trust is at the core of our product and where we expect customers to keep coming back, providing a CE that is designed very thoughtfully and at the same time delivered consistently becomes very critical. To ensure that the customer is indeed at the center of every decision, “Blow away customer expectations” is one of the core organizational values and an inherent part of the DNA at Yeloit.com.",

"Head1":"What is the customer expecting from us?",
"Content2":"This question needs to be asked for any engagement or interaction our customer has with us – a push notification, a new feature, a new offer, a clause of the T&C, a category launch, the location of a store, or even how a merchant interacts with them. Over time, we have been able to break these expectations down into 6 distinct buckets which we call the customer expectation framework. Delivery of promise Did I get what I was promised? This is why a customer came to you in the first place. There was a promise, and the customer expects you to fulfill it each time, every time. You fail to deliver your promise, you fail the customer.  It is thus extremely important to be clear & precise in what you promise & how you promise it. It’s equally important to ensure that you’ve designed your product to deliver on the promise consistently, with the same quality every single time. Make it simple Can I get what I want in the simplest, most efficient way possible? You have to make your product or service easy to use or access so the customer can get the desired benefits quickly with the least possible effort. Remember,  a user does not owe you any effort. Any extra effort required to use the product becomes a deterrent in creating a repeat purchase. This poses a big risk to customer retention, especially for products like ours where the promise is delivered over a longer period of time and which depends on repeated customer interactions. They are willing to understand, adjust and continue to put their faith in you if you’re honest and proactive about any mistakes you make. In fact, customers highly appreciate it if you pre-empt unhappy experiences, communicate honestly and sincerely and provide reasonable, acceptable alternatives. Ensure trust & safety Can I trust them with my life and safety? These are the inherent pillars of a brand. You are because they are. They trust you with their personal data, and their lives. You owe it to all your customers  to provide them with physical, and emotional safety and to safeguard their) personal data &  interests. Ensuring this requires the organization to make some tough choices and takes significant effort. Worst of all, your investment in these areas doesn’t even show until the eventual day of misfortune when something goes wrong and it may potentially impact your customer or their families. Investing in setting the right trust & safety processes is the hidden cost of creating a brand that is trusted for ‘doing the right thing’."
